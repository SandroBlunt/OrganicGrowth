/**
 * News Carousel Production-Spec contract — the second wired Recipe's own media-instructions shape
 * (CONTEXT.md "Production Spec"; ADR-0009/0010/0016; issue #81, map ticket #77).
 *
 * Unlike the wired *Character Explainer with Cast* Recipe (3 `character_concepts` + 3 `clips` + 3
 * `thumbnails`, `contract.ts`), the **News Carousel** Recipe drives the single-lane "Carrousel" Space
 * with one JSON array of exactly 7 slides, injected wholesale into that Space's "Slides Prompts" node
 * (`recipe/registry.ts`'s `NEWS_CAROUSEL` entry) — no per-slide run-point, no gate.
 *
 * --- Shape decided by the #77 prototype (GO on the thin-spec bet, with one refinement) ---
 *
 * Ticket #77 prototyped the Recipe Skill authoring on-contract carousel prompts from the Format's
 * Baseline Prompt + a real Brief, and audited the output against the author-phase checklist: truly
 * MINIMAL `{ slide_index, image_prompt }` was not enough, because re-running that checklist (text
 * length, role order, card style) needs STRUCTURED fields, not a ~250-word prompt parsed after the
 * fact. The stored Spec therefore keeps the handful of fields the checklist actually audits —
 * `role`, `card_style`, `stat_callout`, `text` — alongside `image_prompt`; everything richer (card
 * styles' visual definitions, the pill/eyebrow mechanics, logo placement, fonts) stays in the Format's
 * Baseline Prompt document (ADR-0015), never persisted here.
 *
 * --- Exactly 7 slides, roles in FIXED order ---
 *
 * A News Carousel post is always 7 slides, one per role, in this exact order: `hook` (the stopping
 * headline) -> `then` (what used to be true) -> `shift` (what changed) -> `proof` (a grounded, real
 * example) -> `different` (why this time is different) -> `next` (what happens next) -> `cta` (the
 * close). `slide_index` is 0-based and SHALL equal the slide's position (`CAROUSEL_ROLES`'s index for
 * its role) — the Producer/driver injects the array in this order; there is no per-slide run-point to
 * reorder against.
