  Use when the thin Producer runs ANY Recipe's shared, out-of-canvas copy step (ADR-0012) — the
  Skill named by that Recipe's `copySkill` field (`src/recipe/registry.ts`; both wired Recipes name
  this one today). Composes one Asset's caption + hashtags, in the resolved Format's own voice, from
  the Brand's hard rules, the Idea's material, and — once the media exists — what was actually
  produced: for a multi-slide Recipe, the saved Production Spec's own per-slide narrative, sharpened
  into the caption's plain-language recap. Hands off to the SAME deterministic checker every Copy
  already goes through (`injectRequiredParts` then `validateCopy`). Does NOT run the Space, pick a

# Write: social copy

You compose one **Asset**'s **Copy** — the caption + hashtags a Recipe's shared, out-of-canvas copy
step produces (CONTEXT.md "Copy"; ADR-0012) — the copywriting counterpart to a Recipe's own
media-authoring Skill. Where an author Skill (`produce-news-carousel`, `produce-character-explainer`)
writes the Production Spec that drives the Space, THIS Skill writes the text that ships ALONGSIDE the
rendered media once it exists. You **generate, never publish** (always-rule 1; ADR-0002).

**Swappable, mirroring the per-recipe author Skills.** The thin Producer resolves you by slug from the
job's Recipe: `getRecipe(job.recipe).copySkill` (`src/recipe/registry.ts`) — never hard-coded in
`producer.md`'s own prose. Both wired Recipes (`character-explainer-with-cast`, `news-carousel`) name
`write-social-copy` today; a Recipe with genuinely different copywriting needs could point its own
`copySkill` at a different Skill slug without touching this file, the other Recipe's config, or the
Producer's own conductor prose.

## Inputs — load what's available; nothing here ever blocks a run by itself

1. **Brand hard rules** — `data/brands/<slug>/brand-profile.yaml`, read via
   `src/production-spec/brand-profile.ts`'s `loadCopyRules`: the required CTA, the required hashtags,
   and the banned words every composed Copy must respect (ADR-0012).
2. **The resolved Format's voice** — how this caption should read (`FormatFile.voice`,
   `src/format/store.ts`).
3. **The Idea's material** — its title/hook, angle, and own hashtag set (`src/copy/draft.ts`'s
   `CopyInput`, which drafts the `Copy` shape — `{ caption, hashtags }` — defined in
   `src/copy/contract.ts`).
4. **What was actually produced, once the media exists** — Copy composes LATE, in the Operator's
   session, after the render (and any picked Character) exists, so it can refer to the REAL result
   (ADR-0012). For a single-media Recipe this is free text (`CopyInput.mediaContext`, e.g. the picked
   Character's name). For a multi-slide Recipe (e.g. News Carousel) this is richer: the saved
   Production Spec's own per-slide `role`/`text`/`stat_callout`/`companies` (`CopyInput.slideNarrative`,
   an array of `CopySlideBeat`) — the ACTUAL authored narrative, not a re-guess from the brief. A
   beat's `companies` (issue #120) is that slide's own, already-verified real-companies/products list —
   the SAME list that drives the rendered slide's own logo row — carried through unchanged, including
   an empty array when a slide names no real company.
5. **The chosen Recipe's own copy shape** — `Recipe.copyShape` (`maxChars`/`minEmojis`/`maxEmojis`) —
   never a fixed 180-char/1-3-emoji constant; a different Recipe declares its own bounds.

## Steps

### 1. Draft the caption — sharpen the produced narrative, never a generic restatement of the brief

Write the caption yourself, in the resolved Format's own voice. This is your job as the LLM — never a
fixed template.

- **When `slideNarrative` is available (a multi-slide Recipe, once the media exists):** sharpen the
  ACTUAL produced on-slide narrative — open on the `"hook"` beat, carry the concrete `"shift"` (what
  changed) through the middle, and close on the `"cta"` beat — into a plain-language recap of what
  happened and what it means, exactly the comprehension standard the Baseline Prompt's own "7-slide
  narrative" formula sets for the on-slide lines themselves (epic #106 item 6). This is sharpening
  real, already-authored content — never re-deriving a caption from the brief alone, and never
  inventing a fact the produced on-slide narrative doesn't already contain.
- **Name the real companies/products, grounded in each beat's `companies` list** (issue #120): wherever
  the Format's voice naturally allows it, name the companies/products a slide's own `companies` field
  actually records — this is the Production Spec's own, already-verified list, not a re-guess from the
  brief's prose. A beat whose `companies` is empty or absent contributes NO company/product mention —
  never invent or re-guess one from the title/angle/mediaContext when the produced narrative doesn't
  name one. This is the SAME "grounded, never invented" standard the News Carousel author phase's own
  `companies-cited` checklist item already holds the on-slide `image_prompt` to
  (`production-spec/news-carousel-author-checklist.ts`) — the caption's own wording is your judgment
  call as the LLM (never a fixed template); only which companies exist to draw on is fixed by the data.
- **When no slide narrative is available (a single-media Recipe):** draft from the Idea's `title`,
  `angle`, and `mediaContext` — richer than a bare title-only restatement, still grounded only in the
  supplied material, never invented.
- **Never an em dash, en dash, or a hyphen used as a sentence dash** (issue #108) — write separate
  short sentences instead. An ordinary hyphenated word (`state-of-the-art`) is unaffected.
- **Close on a FRESH engagement CTA every time — never a canned, repeated line (Operator QA,
  2026-07-22).** End the caption by inviting the reader to *comment their thoughts* or *follow for
  more*, paraphrased in a new, catchy way for THIS story — tie it to the specific topic (a real
  question they'd want to answer, or a reason to follow that names what they keep getting). Do NOT
  reuse a fixed, mechanical closer across posts — the boilerplate `"Swipe through the 7-slide
  breakdown 👉"` (and any near-identical variant) is the exact anti-pattern the Operator flagged as
  repetitive; it must not appear again. Vary the phrasing, the ask (comment vs. follow), and the emoji
  (0-2, within `copyShape`) from one Asset to the next, the same way the Baseline Prompt's cta-role
  close line is varied per story. Examples of the *shape* (write a new one each time, never copy
  these): "Would you actually put this on your desk? Tell us in the comments." / "Yes or no in the
  comments: would you let it?" / "Follow Straw Motion for the plain read on every big AI move."
- Carry the Idea's own hashtags through unchanged into the drafted Copy's `hashtags` — the Brand's
  required hashtags are injected separately, deterministically, in the next step.

`src/copy/draft.ts`'s `skillDraftCopy` is this step's deterministic, testable proof: given the SAME
`CopyInput`/`CopyShape` this Skill reads, it produces a `Copy` demonstrating exactly this behavior
(sharpens `slideNarrative`'s hook/shift/cta beats when present; falls back to
title/angle/mediaContext otherwise; never a dash tell) — the same relationship
`production-spec/generate.ts`'s deterministic composer has to a Recipe's author Skill. It also proves
each beat's `companies` field is genuinely AVAILABLE to a drafter, mechanically (issue #120) — a
`slideNarrative` carrying `companies` never changes `skillDraftCopy`'s own deterministic output, since
naming companies naturally in the caption's wording is YOUR job as the LLM, not something a fixed
template can prove; only that the data is there to draw from is mechanically checked.

### 2. Hand off to the deterministic checker — never check your own work by eye

1. **Inject the Brand's required parts deterministically** — `src/copy/inject.ts`'s
   `injectRequiredParts` appends the required CTA/hashtags from the Brand Profile when absent, and
   dedupes when they're already present. You do not write this step's logic; you call it.
2. **Check the result** with `src/copy/validate.ts`'s `validateCopy` against the chosen Recipe's own
   `copyShape` and the Brand's copy rules: caption length, emoji count, required CTA present, required
   hashtags present, no banned word, and no em dash/en dash/spaced hyphen (issue #108) — in the
   caption or any hashtag.
3. **Redraft on a soft miss** (e.g. wrong emoji count, over length) and re-check. **A banned word OR a
   dash tell is REJECT-ONLY — STOP and report; never silently swap the offending word or rewrite it
   for the model.** This mirrors the SAME reject-only contract every Recipe's author-phase banned-word
   scan already follows (always-rule 6/9).

Completion: `validateCopy(...).ok` is `true` (confirmed by `auditCopyPhase`,
`src/recipe/phase-contract.ts`, the Producer's own phase self-audit).

## What this Skill does not do

- It does not run the Space, drive a canvas, pick a gate, or call any `spaces_*`/`creations_*` tool —
  the Producer already drove the Recipe's canvas to a finished render (or a paused gate's pick) BEFORE
  this Skill ever runs; composing Copy is a separate, later, out-of-canvas step (ADR-0012).
  Sharpening the on-slide narrative into the caption never means re-rendering or editing the media
  itself — the rendered pixels are already final by the time this Skill runs.
- It does not author the Production Spec or the media prompt — that is the Recipe's OWN
  media-authoring Skill (`produce-news-carousel`, `produce-character-explainer`), run earlier, in a
  separate step.
- It does not set the watermark `@handle` — that is a Space parameter, a Brand-wide value, never part
  of Copy (ADR-0012).
- It does not publish anything, ever (always-rule 1; ADR-0002). A human reviews the saved Copy at the
  Publish gate and posts it.
