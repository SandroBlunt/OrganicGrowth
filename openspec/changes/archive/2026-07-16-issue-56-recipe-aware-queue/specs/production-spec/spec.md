## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Compose and persist a Production Spec beside the Brief, segmented by Recipe

The Producer SHALL compose a contract-conformant Production Spec from an accepted Brief and persist it
to the Brand's `data/brands/<slug>/ideas/<run>/idea-NN.<recipe>.spec.json` (the machine-readable
sibling of the Brief, now segmented by the chosen Recipe — ADR-0011, issue #56), so the Operator can
inspect exactly what will drive a render and so a SECOND chosen Recipe for the same Idea gets its OWN
Spec file rather than overwriting the first Recipe's. `recipe` SHALL be a required, explicit parameter
(never defaulted or inferred) to both `specPathFor` and `composeSpec`'s options. The persisted Spec
SHALL pass `validate()` and the brand-safety filter; a Spec that fails either SHALL NOT be written.

#### Scenario: Composing an accepted Idea writes a valid, Recipe-segmented Spec beside the Brief

- **GIVEN** an accepted Brief for Idea `idea-NN` in run `<run>`, composed for Recipe `<recipe>`
- **WHEN** the Producer composes its Production Spec
- **THEN** a file `data/brands/<slug>/ideas/<run>/idea-NN.<recipe>.spec.json` is written
- **AND** the written Spec passes `validate()` and the brand-safety filter

#### Scenario: Two Recipes of one Idea each get their own Spec file

- **GIVEN** one accepted Idea with TWO chosen Recipes, `character-explainer-with-cast` and `carousel`
- **WHEN** a Production Spec is composed and saved for each Recipe
- **THEN** the two Specs are written to two DIFFERENT paths, each segmented by its own Recipe
- **AND** neither Spec overwrites the other

#### Scenario: A failing Spec is refused, not written

- **GIVEN** a candidate Spec that fails validation or contains a banned word
- **WHEN** persistence is attempted
- **THEN** no `idea-NN.<recipe>.spec.json` is written and the failure is reported
